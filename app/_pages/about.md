# Hey there — I’m **Dominic** 👋

I’m a roaming **cloud & security engineer** fueled by curiosity and systems thinking — from automating Kubernetes clusters and hardening networks to translating technical patterns into immersive soundscapes. When I’m not in front of a terminal, you’ll likely find me on a trail, passport in hand, soaking up new horizons and local cuisine.

## Professional Focus

- **Cybersecurity & Purple Teaming**  ·  Identify blind spots, patch them, and codify lessons into repeatable defense playbooks.  
- **DevSecOps Automation**  ·  Bake compliance into CI/CD with Terraform, Kubernetes, and policy‑as‑code.  
- **LLM & AI Engineering**  ·  Build Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots and private LLM stacks with Ollama, LangChain, and vector stores like Chroma.  
- **Infrastructure & Networking**  ·  Operate Docker and Kubernetes at scale on AWS, GCP, and bare‑metal; tune proxies, firewalls, and router configs for zero‑trust connectivity.

## When I’m Not Shipping Code

- **Travel & Culture 🌎**  ·  Collecting passport stamps and street‑food recipes. Recent favorites: Seeing Iguaçu Falls, Onsens in Bepu, and Rio's blend of city and nature.  
- **Music Production 🎧**  ·  Releasing melodic bass & halftime tracks as **Poelyte** — listen on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/poelyte).  
- **Nature Finding**  ·  Recharging within nature's embrace, whether it's a hike or a bike ride.  
- **Community & Learning 🤝**  ·  Hosting CTF workshops with DC702 and mentoring newcomers on secure coding and infra‑as‑code best practices.
