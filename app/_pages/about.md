## Who am I?!


I started my journey by playing with emulators, fixing electronics, and modding smartphones in grade school. After tinkering with custom ROMs/firmware and getting my A+, I fell in love with Development and found an internship that led to a full-stack Developer role. From there, I continued to dive into Networking, Cloud computing, and Containerization, which led me into the DevOps community. I have always been an enthusiast of security and privacy, optimizing and streamlining processes, and doing better in any capacity. When I am not learning or tinkering with technology, I am usually out in nature or moving around and listening to an audiobook. I enjoy making music, listening to audiobooks( I also enjoy reading, but it's easier to move and listen than to read), and exploring new hobbies.
 
 Passionate to learn, excited to grow, and eager to collaborate with everyone!

## What is this?

"MySpace" but mine. I like to post about projects currently undergoing and about events I find interesting. Almost always open to conversate, send me a message on Linkedin ;)
